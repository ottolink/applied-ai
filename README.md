# WhatsApp Agent Workflow

This repository contains an **n8n workflow** designed to act as a WhatsApp agent that can:

- Receive messages from WhatsApp  
- Process those messages with AI (using tools like OpenAI Chat Model)  
- Store personal notes in a database (Supabase/Postgres)  
- Create reminders and tasks based on user inputs  

The workflow effectively acts as a personal assistant, allowing you to remember notes, schedule tasks, and keep track of important items directly from WhatsApp.

## Features

- **WhatsApp Trigger:**  
  Instantly receive and respond to new messages on WhatsApp.

- **AI Chat Agent:**  
  Uses AI (like OpenAI Chat Model) to generate intelligent responses and process user commands.

- **Supabase/Postgres Integration:**  
  Stores personal notes, reminders, and user data for later retrieval.

- **Automatic Task Creation:**  
  Creates tasks and reminders based on message content (e.g., using keywords like "note," "task," or "remind me").

- **Contextual Memory:**  
  Remembers previous interactions so you can maintain a history of conversations and tasks.

---

## Architecture & Nodes

The workflow consists of the following nodes (refer to the provided screenshot for visual details):

1. **WhatsApp Trigger:** Listens for incoming WhatsApp messages.
2. **Postgres (via Supabase):** Handles storage and retrieval of personal notes and tasks.
3. **AI Agent (Tools Agent):** Processes incoming messages to determine the appropriate action.
4. **OpenAI Chat Model:** Generates responses or performs task-specific processing.
5. **Postgres Chat Memory:** Saves or retrieves historical conversation data.
6. **Create User:** Adds or updates user records based on phone numbers.
7. **Add Tasks:** Inserts new tasks or reminders into the database.
8. **WhatsApp Business Cloud (Send):** Sends the generated responses back to the WhatsApp user.

---

## Prerequisites

Before using this workflow, ensure you have the following:

1. **n8n**  
   - [Installation Guide](https://docs.n8n.io/getting-started/installation/)  
   - Use a version compatible with these nodes (version 0.210.0 or later is recommended).

2. **Supabase/Postgres:**  
   - A Supabase account or access to a Postgres database.  
   - Necessary credentials (host, port, database name, user, and password).

3. **OpenAI API Key:**  
   - To authenticate and use the OpenAI Chat Model for generating AI responses.

4. **WhatsApp Business Cloud API:**  
   - Access Token and associated details for sending/receiving messages.
   - Ensure your Facebook Developer account and WhatsApp Business setup are complete.

5. **Optional Environment Variables:**  
   If preferred, set up environment variables (e.g., `SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `WHATSAPP_TOKEN`) and reference them in your n8n credential settings.

## Installation & Setup

Follow these steps to get your workflow up and running:

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<YOUR_USERNAME>/<REPO_NAME>.git
   cd <REPO_NAME>
   ```

2. **Import the Workflow into n8n:**
   - If you have exported the workflow JSON file, import it into n8n via the “Import” button.
   - Alternatively, you can manually recreate the nodes following the diagram provided.

3. **Configure Credentials:**
   - In the n8n UI, navigate to the **Credentials** section.
   - Create new credentials for your:
     - **Postgres Database (Supabase)**
     - **OpenAI API**
     - **WhatsApp Business API**
   - Ensure that each node in your workflow is assigned the appropriate credentials.

4. **Set Environment Variables (if applicable):**
   - Create or update your environment configuration (e.g., in a `.env` file) with:
     ```bash
     export SUPABASE_URL="your_supabase_url"
     export SUPABASE_ANON_KEY="your_supabase_anon_key"
     export OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_api_key"
     export WHATSAPP_TOKEN="your_whatsapp_business_token"
     ```
   - Make sure your n8n instance is set to read these variables.

5. **Activate the Workflow:**
   - Open the workflow in n8n and click “Activate” to start listening for incoming WhatsApp messages.

## Usage

1. **Sending a WhatsApp Message:**
   - Send a message to your WhatsApp bot number.
   - The workflow will trigger automatically, process your message via the AI agent, and take the corresponding action.

2. **Creating Notes and Tasks:**
   - Use keywords like “note,” “task,” or “remind me” in your message.
   - The AI agent processes the request, and the related data is stored in Postgres via Supabase.

3. **Receiving Reminders:**
   - Based on the tasks created, the workflow will remind you of upcoming items.
   - Future interactions can query previously stored data to maintain context.

4. **AI Generated Responses:**
   - The OpenAI Chat Model provides responses or further instructions based on your input and conversation history.

## Node-by-Node Explanation

1. **WhatsApp Trigger:**
   - Initiates the workflow upon receiving a new message.

2. **Postgres (select):**
   - Retrieves existing records or conversation history from the database.

3. **AI Agent (Tools Agent):**
   - Processes the received message to determine the next actions.

4. **OpenAI Chat Model:**
   - Generates a response based on the processed message data.

5. **Postgres Chat Memory:**
   - Manages storage and retrieval of conversation history.

6. **Create User:**
   - Inserts or updates user data based on the incoming message.

7. **Add Tasks:**
   - Creates records for tasks or reminders in your database.

8. **WhatsApp Business Cloud (send):**
   - Sends the final response back to the user on WhatsApp.
